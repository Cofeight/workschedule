# workschedule

This assignment involved the creation of a work schedule that logs inputs to local storage for later access. an additional element conveys time status to each of the rows; a gray box for time in the past, a salmon box for present, and a greenyellow box for future. 

I had difficulty implementing the localstorage command, and was not able to save inputs to the local storage. I will be following up with additional research and tutor sessions to solidify my understanding of this task.
